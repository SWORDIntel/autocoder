# Deepseek API Integration Module Documentation

## Overview

`deepseek.js` is a utility module that provides an interface to interact with the Deepseek AI API. It's designed to generate text responses using Deepseek's language model through their API service. This module is part of a larger project that appears to include various agent-based services and server functionality.

## File Location

```
/deepseek.js
```

## Dependencies

-   `chalk`: Used for colored console output
-   `openai`: OpenAI API client library (used to interact with Deepseek's API)

## Configuration Requirements

-   Requires `DEEPSEEK_KEY` environment variable to be set with a valid Deepseek API key

## Main Function

### `getTextDeepseek`

#### Description

Sends a prompt to the Deepseek API and retrieves an AI-generated response.

#### Syntax

```javascript
async getTextDeepseek(prompt, temperature)
```

#### Parameters

-   `prompt` (string, required): The input text prompt to send to the Deepseek API
-   `temperature` (number, optional): Controls randomness in the response.
    -   Default: 0.7
    -   Range: 0.0 to 1.0
    -   Lower values make responses more focused and deterministic
    -   Higher values make responses more creative and diverse

#### Returns

```javascript
{
    content: [
        {
            text: string, // The generated response from Deepseek
        },
    ];
}
```

#### Error Handling

-   Checks for the presence of `DEEPSEEK_KEY` environment variable
-   Exits process with status code 1 if the key is not found
-   Displays error message in red using chalk

#### Configuration Details

-   Model: "deepseek-reasoner"
-   Maximum tokens: 8192
-   Base URL: "https://api.deepseek.com"

## Usage Example

```javascript
import { getTextDeepseek } from "./deepseek.js";

async function generateText() {
    try {
        const response = await getTextDeepseek("Explain the concept of artificial intelligence", 0.5);
        console.log(response.content[0].text);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error generating text:", error);
    }
}
```

## Integration Context

This module appears to be part of a larger system that includes various specialized agents (Business Analyst, DevOps, etc.) and likely serves as a core component for AI-powered text generation across these agents.

## Security Considerations

-   API key must be kept secure and not committed to version control
-   Should be used in conjunction with proper rate limiting and error handling
-   Environment variables should be properly configured in production environments

## Best Practices

1. Always handle API errors appropriately
2. Monitor API usage and costs
3. Cache responses when appropriate
4. Implement retry logic for failed requests
5. Use appropriate temperature values based on the use case

## Related Files

-   `model.js`: Likely contains additional model configurations
-   `config.js`: May contain additional configuration settings
-   Other agent files that might consume this service

## Future Improvements

1. Add retry mechanism for failed API calls
2. Implement response caching
3. Add more error handling and validation
4. Support for streaming responses
5. Add request timeout handling
