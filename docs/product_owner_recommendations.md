As the Product Owner Agent, I'll provide a comprehensive analysis and prioritization for AutoCode.

## 1. Prioritized Features for Next Sprint

1. **Core Code Generation Engine Enhancement**
   - Priority: Highest
   - Improve the accuracy and reliability of code generation using Claude 3.5 Sonnet API
   - Focus on handling complex project structures and maintaining context across multiple files

2. **License Management System Implementation**
   - Priority: High
   - Complete the license server integration
   - Implement tiered pricing validation
   - Enable license key generation and verification

3. **Code Analysis and Quality Checks**
   - Priority: Medium-High
   - Implement automated code quality scanning
   - Add support for common linting tools
   - Provide actionable improvement suggestions

4. **Multi-language Support Foundation**
   - Priority: Medium
   - Start with JavaScript/TypeScript and Python support
   - Implement language-specific configuration handling
   - Set up basic linting and formatting rules

5. **User Interface Enhancement**
   - Priority: Medium
   - Improve CLI feedback and progress indicators
   - Add interactive mode for project configuration
   - Implement better error handling and user guidance

## 2. Feature Explanations

### Core Code Generation Engine Enhancement
This is our highest priority as it's the foundation of AutoCode. We need to ensure the code generation is reliable and produces high-quality output. This will directly impact user satisfaction and adoption.

### License Management System
With the basic functionality in place, we need to implement proper licensing to monetize the product. This includes both free and paid tiers with appropriate feature restrictions.

### Code Analysis and Quality Checks
This feature will differentiate us from simple code generators by ensuring the generated code meets industry standards and best practices.

### Multi-language Support Foundation
Starting with two popular languages will allow us to test and refine our language support architecture before expanding to others.

### User Interface Enhancement
Improving user experience will reduce friction and increase adoption. Clear feedback and guidance are essential for new users.

## 3. Potential New Features

1. **Template Repository**
   - Allow users to save and share their successful generation patterns
   - Create a marketplace for custom templates

2. **Integration with Popular IDEs**
   - VS Code extension
   - JetBrains plugin

3. **Real-time Collaboration**
   - Allow multiple developers to work on the same project
   - Share and merge generated code

4. **API Generation**
   - Automatic REST/GraphQL API generation
   - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

## 4. Risks and Concerns

1. **API Reliability**
   - Risk: Claude API availability and response times
   - Mitigation: Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms

2. **Code Quality**
   - Risk: Generated code might not meet all project requirements
   - Mitigation: Implement thorough validation and testing

3. **Security**
   - Risk: Sensitive information in README files
   - Mitigation: Add content scanning and warning system

4. **Scalability**
   - Risk: Performance issues with large projects
   - Mitigation: Implement incremental generation and caching

## 5. Recommendations for Development Team

1. **Testing Strategy**
   - Implement comprehensive unit tests for each module
   - Create integration tests for the entire generation pipeline
   - Set up automated testing in CI/CD

2. **Documentation**
   - Maintain detailed API documentation
   - Create developer guides for each supported language
   - Document internal architecture decisions

3. **Code Organization**
   - Follow modular architecture
   - Implement clear separation of concerns
   - Use dependency injection for better testability

4. **Performance**
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Optimize API calls
   - Monitor and log performance metrics

5. **Collaboration**
   - Regular code reviews
   - Daily standups to address blockers
   - Weekly architecture discussions

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide additional information?
