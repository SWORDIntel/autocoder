# FileManager Module Documentation

## Overview

The `FileManager` module provides a set of utility functions for file and directory operations in the context of a code analysis and documentation generation project. It handles reading and writing files, creating directories, and filtering files based on various criteria.

This module is a crucial part of the project, interacting with the file system to process source code files for analysis and documentation generation. It works in conjunction with other modules like `codeAnalyzer.js`, `documentationGenerator.js`, and `config.js` to facilitate the project's main functionality.

## Imports

-   `fs/promises`: For asynchronous file system operations
-   `path`: For handling file and directory paths
-   `chalk`: For colorful console output
-   `ignore`: For parsing `.gitignore` files
-   `CONFIG`: Configuration object imported from `config.js`

## Methods

### read(filePath)

Reads the content of a file asynchronously.

**Parameters:**

-   `filePath` (string): The path to the file to be read

**Returns:**

-   `Promise<string|null>`: The content of the file as a string, or `null` if an error occurs

**Example:**

```javascript
const content = await FileManager.read("path/to/file.js");
if (content) {
    console.log("File content:", content);
}
```

### write(filePath, content)

Writes content to a file asynchronously.

**Parameters:**

-   `filePath` (string): The path to the file to be written
-   `content` (string): The content to write to the file

**Returns:**

-   `Promise<void>`

**Example:**

```javascript
await FileManager.write("path/to/output.js", 'console.log("Hello, World!");');
```

### createSubfolders(filePath)

Creates all necessary subdirectories for a given file path.

**Parameters:**

-   `filePath` (string): The path for which to create subdirectories

**Returns:**

-   `Promise<void>`

**Example:**

```javascript
await FileManager.createSubfolders("path/to/new/directory/file.js");
```

### getFilesToProcess()

Retrieves a list of files to be processed, respecting `.gitignore` rules and project-specific exclusions.

**Returns:**

-   `Promise<string[]>`: An array of relative file paths to be processed

**Example:**

```javascript
const filesToProcess = await FileManager.getFilesToProcess();
console.log("Files to process:", filesToProcess);
```

### getProjectStructure()

Generates an object representation of the project's file structure.

**Returns:**

-   `Promise<Object>`: An object representing the project's file structure

**Example:**

```javascript
const structure = await FileManager.getProjectStructure();
console.log("Project structure:", JSON.stringify(structure, null, 2));
```

## Usage in the Project

The `FileManager` module is likely used by other components of the project, such as:

-   `codeAnalyzer.js` might use it to read source files for analysis.
-   `documentationGenerator.js` could use it to write generated documentation to files.
-   `index.js` might use it to orchestrate file operations across the project.

The module's ability to filter files based on `.gitignore` rules and project-specific exclusions ensures that only relevant files are processed, improving efficiency and avoiding unnecessary operations on non-source files or dependencies.

## Error Handling

The module uses `try-catch` blocks and `chalk` to provide colorful console output for both successful operations and errors, enhancing readability of logs during execution.

## Configuration

The module relies on the `CONFIG` object imported from `config.js`, which likely contains settings for file exclusions and other project-wide configurations. This allows for easy customization of the file processing behavior without modifying the `FileManager` code directly.
