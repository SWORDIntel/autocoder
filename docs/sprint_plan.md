Here's a sprint plan based on the current product backlog and project state:

# Sprint Plan

## Sprint Goal

Implement the core AI agents system and enhance server-side functionality to create a solid foundation for AutoCode's intelligent project management capabilities.

## Selected User Stories/Tasks

1. **High Priority**: Implement AI agents system architecture

    - Estimate: 13 story points
    - Create a modular framework for AI agents
    - Integrate existing agent files into the system
    - Develop inter-agent communication mechanism

2. **High Priority**: Complete auth route implementation

    - Estimate: 8 story points
    - Finish user registration and login functionality
    - Implement password reset feature
    - Integrate with MongoDB for user data storage

3. **High Priority**: Implement dashboard route

    - Estimate: 5 story points
    - Create dashboard view with project overview
    - Implement basic project management features

4. **Medium Priority**: Enhance documentationGenerator.js

    - Estimate: 8 story points
    - Improve API documentation generation
    - Create user guide generation for different roles

5. **Medium Priority**: Implement multi-language support in codeGenerator.js

    - Estimate: 13 story points
    - Extend code generation capabilities to support multiple languages
    - Implement language-specific configuration handling

6. **Low Priority**: Improve CLI experience in userInterface.js

    - Estimate: 5 story points
    - Enhance command-line interface with better prompts and error handling
    - Implement progress indicators for long-running tasks

7. **Low Priority**: Implement basic email functionality
    - Estimate: 3 story points
    - Set up email service integration
    - Create and send welcome emails to new users

## Dependencies and Risks

-   The AI agents system (Task 1) is a foundational component that other features will depend on. Delays in this task could impact future sprints.
-   Multi-language support (Task 5) may require additional research and testing for less common languages, potentially affecting the timeline.
-   Email functionality (Task 7) depends on choosing and integrating with an email service provider, which may require additional setup time.

## Definition of Done

For this sprint to be considered complete:

1. All selected tasks must be implemented, tested, and functioning as expected.
2. Code for all new features must pass code review and adhere to project coding standards.
3. Unit tests must be written and passing for all new functionality.
4. Documentation must be updated to reflect new features and changes.
5. All new features must be successfully integrated into the main branch without conflicts.
6. The AI agents system must demonstrate basic inter-agent communication.
7. The server must be able to handle user authentication, display a basic dashboard, and send welcome emails.
8. The code generator must support at least three different programming languages.
9. The CLI must show noticeable improvements in user experience.
10. A sprint review meeting must be held to demonstrate new features to stakeholders.

This sprint plan focuses on implementing the core AI agents system and enhancing server-side functionality, which are crucial for AutoCode's intelligent project management capabilities. The selected tasks balance high-priority foundational work with some medium and low-priority improvements to provide a well-rounded sprint outcome.
