Here's an updated product backlog based on the current project state and recent developments:

# Updated Product Backlog

## High Priority

1. Implement AI agents system
   - Create a modular architecture for AI agents
   - Integrate existing agent files (BusinessAnalystAgent.js, DevOpsAgent.js, etc.) into the system
   - Develop a mechanism for agents to communicate and collaborate

2. Enhance server-side functionality
   - Complete implementation of auth, dashboard, payment, and profile routes
   - Integrate MongoDB for data persistence
   - Implement email functionality for welcome and password reset

3. Improve documentation generation
   - Enhance documentationGenerator.js to create comprehensive API documentation
   - Generate user guides for different user roles (developers, project managers, etc.)

4. Implement multi-language support
   - Extend codeGenerator.js to handle multiple programming languages
   - Create language-specific linting and formatting configurations

## Medium Priority

5. Develop user interface improvements
   - Enhance CLI experience in userInterface.js
   - Create a web-based interface for project management and code generation

6. Implement advanced code analysis features
   - Enhance codeAnalyzer.js with more sophisticated code quality checks
   - Implement automatic refactoring suggestions

7. Enhance license management system
   - Implement tiered pricing model in licenseManager.js
   - Integrate with payment system for automatic license upgrades/downgrades

8. Improve project context management
   - Develop a system to maintain project context across multiple sessions
   - Implement intelligent decision-making based on project history

## Low Priority

9. Implement plugin system
   - Create a plugin architecture to allow third-party extensions
   - Develop a marketplace for AutoCode plugins

10. Enhance internationalization support
    - Implement multi-language support for generated documentation
    - Create localized versions of the CLI and web interface

11. Develop advanced DevOps features
    - Implement automatic CI/CD pipeline generation
    - Create Docker container configurations for generated projects

## Completed Items

- Basic project structure implementation
- Initial server setup with Express.js
- Creation of main AutoCode components (codeGenerator.js, fileManager.js, etc.)
- Implementation of basic AI agent files

## Additional Notes

- The AI agents system should be a top priority to leverage the full potential of the existing agent files.
- We should focus on improving the core functionality (code generation, analysis, and documentation) before expanding to more advanced features.
- User feedback should be collected and incorporated into the backlog regularly to ensure we're meeting real-world needs.
- Consider creating a roadmap for long-term feature development and communicate it to stakeholders.

This updated backlog reflects the current state of the project and prioritizes the implementation of the AI agents system, which is a key differentiator for AutoCode. It also emphasizes the importance of completing the server-side functionality and enhancing core features like documentation generation and multi-language support.
