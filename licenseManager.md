# LicenseManager Module Documentation

## Overview

The `licenseManager.js` file is a crucial component of the project, responsible for handling user authentication, registration, and license management. It interacts with a license server to perform various operations related to user accounts and licensing tiers.

This module is part of a larger project that appears to be a code analysis and generation tool, based on the project structure. It likely works in conjunction with other modules like `codeAnalyzer.js`, `codeGenerator.js`, and `userInterface.js` to provide a complete application experience.

## Imports

```javascript
import { CONFIG } from "./config.js";
```

The module imports the `CONFIG` object from `config.js`, which is expected to contain configuration settings for the application, including the `licenseServerUrl`.

## Constants and Variables

- `serverUrl`: Stores the URL of the license server, obtained from the `CONFIG` object.
- `currentLicense`: Holds the current user's license information. Initially set to `null`.

## LicenseManager Object

The `LicenseManager` object contains methods for managing user accounts and licenses. It is exported as the default export of this module.

### Methods

#### `async login(username, password)`

Authenticates a user with the license server.

**Parameters:**
- `username` (string): The user's username.
- `password` (string): The user's password.

**Returns:**
- `Promise<boolean>`: Resolves to `true` if login is successful, `false` otherwise.

**Usage Example:**
```javascript
const loggedIn = await LicenseManager.login("user@example.com", "password123");
if (loggedIn) {
    console.log("Login successful");
} else {
    console.log("Login failed");
}
```

#### `async register(username, password, tier)`

Registers a new user with the license server.

**Parameters:**
- `username` (string): The new user's username.
- `password` (string): The new user's password.
- `tier` (string): The license tier for the new user (e.g., "Free", "Premium").

**Returns:**
- `Promise<boolean>`: Resolves to `true` if registration is successful, `false` otherwise.

**Usage Example:**
```javascript
const registered = await LicenseManager.register("newuser@example.com", "newpassword", "Premium");
if (registered) {
    console.log("Registration successful");
} else {
    console.log("Registration failed");
}
```

#### `async checkLicense()`

Checks the validity of the current license with the server. 

**Note:** This method is currently stubbed to always return `true`. The actual implementation is commented out.

**Returns:**
- `Promise<boolean>`: Always resolves to `true` in the current implementation.

**Usage Example:**
```javascript
const isValid = await LicenseManager.checkLicense();
console.log("License is valid:", isValid);
```

#### `getLicenseTier()`

Retrieves the current license tier.

**Returns:**
- `string`: The current license tier, or "Free" if no license is set.

**Usage Example:**
```javascript
const tier = LicenseManager.getLicenseTier();
console.log("Current license tier:", tier);
```

#### `getRemainingRequests()`

Gets the number of remaining requests for the current license.

**Returns:**
- `number`: The number of remaining requests, or `Infinity` for Premium tier.

**Usage Example:**
```javascript
const remaining = LicenseManager.getRemainingRequests();
console.log("Remaining requests:", remaining);
```

#### `async decrementRequests()`

Decrements the number of remaining requests for non-Premium licenses.

**Returns:**
- `Promise<void>`

**Usage Example:**
```javascript
await LicenseManager.decrementRequests();
console.log("Request count decremented");
```

## Error Handling

All methods that interact with the server include error handling. Errors are logged to the console, and appropriate boolean values are returned to indicate success or failure.

## Integration with Project

This `LicenseManager` module is likely used by other parts of the application, such as `userInterface.js`, to manage user sessions, control access to premium features, and track usage limits. It interacts with the license server (presumably `server/license-server.js`) to perform its operations.
