# AutoCode - index.js Documentation

## Overview

This file serves as the entry point for the AutoCode application. It orchestrates the main functionality of the tool, including license validation, README file processing, and user interaction for various actions related to code generation and analysis.

## Dependencies

- `path`: Node.js built-in module for handling file paths
- `chalk`: External library for colorful console output
- `FileManager`: Custom module for file operations
- `UserInterface`: Custom module for handling user interactions
- `LicenseManager`: Custom module for license management

## Main Functions

### `checkLicense()`

Validates the user's license for using the AutoCode tool.

**Returns:**
- `Promise<boolean>`: Resolves to `true` if the license is valid, `false` otherwise.

**Usage:**
```javascript
if (await checkLicense()) {
    // Proceed with application logic
} else {
    // Handle invalid license scenario
}
```

### `main()`

The main function that drives the application's workflow.

**Workflow:**
1. Displays a welcome message
2. Checks for the presence of the `CLAUDE_KEY` environment variable
3. Validates the user's license
4. Reads the project's README.md file
5. Enters a loop to continuously prompt for and handle user actions
6. Exits when the user chooses to quit or the license becomes invalid

**Usage:**
```javascript
main().catch((error) => {
    console.error(chalk.red("‚ùå An error occurred:"), error.message);
});
```

## Error Handling

The application uses a top-level error handler to catch and display any unhandled errors that occur during execution.

## Environment Variables

- `CLAUDE_KEY`: Required for the application to function. Its specific use is not detailed in this file but is likely related to API authentication for code generation or analysis services.

## Project Structure Integration

This file interacts with several other modules in the project:

- `fileManager.js`: Used for reading files and getting the project structure
- `userInterface.js`: Handles user input and action processing
- `licenseManager.js`: Manages license validation

The `main()` function utilizes these modules to provide a cohesive user experience for code analysis, generation, and documentation tasks.

## Usage

To run the AutoCode application:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Set the `CLAUDE_KEY` environment variable
3. Execute the script:

```bash
node index.js
```

or if configured as an executable:

```bash
./index.js
```

## Notes

- The application runs in a loop, allowing multiple actions to be performed in a single session
- License validation is performed at the start and before each action to ensure continuous compliance
- The project structure is re-evaluated before each action, allowing for real-time updates to be reflected in the tool's operations

This entry point file sets up the foundation for a CLI tool that likely assists developers with various code-related tasks, leveraging AI capabilities (as suggested by the `CLAUDE_KEY` requirement) and providing an interactive interface for project management and code operations.
